        "Impactful change begins with education and awareness, so it is our responsibility not only to show support for the Asian community but also to garner understanding and support from others. Confront racism in public, be politically proactive, share resources, and most importantly, engage in meaningful conversations about racism. Share this knowledge with those who may struggle to understand the importance of the issue. In some cases, the conversation may be uncomfortable at first, but a little awkwardness is worthwhile if the other party derives some value from it.",

        "The recent influx of news covering the racism and violence against Asian-Americans and Asian-Canadians has created a media space that may be a major source of anxiety for Asian communities. While we should demonstrate compassion to those around us that are going through these traumatic experiences, it is also important to practice self-care, and breaks from constantly interacting with traumatic content.",
