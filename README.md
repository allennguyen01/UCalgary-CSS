# University of Calgary Chinese Students' Society

Established in 1968, the Chinese Students' Society (CSS) is the pioneering and largest Chinese student club at the University of Calgary. As a non-profit organization, CSS is devoted to promoting Chinese culture while fostering multiculturalism within the club.

We provide a welcoming environment for students to forge new friendships and broaden their social network through a variety of events, including our annual meet and greet, volunteer activities, dances, inter-club sports events, and year-end banquet.
